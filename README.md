It is the first stage of my future fanfiction website. It's kinda backup, so when my laptop decides it has had enough, I won't loose all the data.
There is a more-or-less responsive navbar, sign-up, login and logout options, page access restriction, changing username depending on your cookies, etc. 
Since its only a backup, you should use your own database is you wanna run the app.
Also, since the work is still in process and I am experimenting, an add-post function may not work at all for now, or will be working... weirdly. It has to be that way for now, simply because I don't want the posts to be one-paged, but I have to figure out how to do that, and I have to have a time for it.
I have never written anything in JS, let alone NodeJS, so it's kinda learning while doing.
have a nice day :3
